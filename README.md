# BlackJack Game

# Description
This is an aces high Blackjack game where you, the player is playing against the dealer! This is a one deck game where the objective is to get 21 or closer to 21 than your opponents without going over. If you go over the game will tell you that you have busted, the same goes if the dealer goes over. After the initial deal you will have a choice to hit and add a card or stay and pass the dealer the turn.

# Lessons Learned
The biggest lesson I learned is how to properly plan and design a application, what classes should do what and to think in English before thinking in code. Jumping directly into the coding without a detailed plan is the best way to get confused, frustrated and produce poorly written code. A small issue I had was managing all of my while loops and variable names. I learned being more defined on simple things such as naming a boolean will help me out a lot once in the final stages of developing a program.
